# Version: 1.0
# Description: English Internationalized Hemera strings.
#
# This script must NOT be directly called.

## General constants
## Hemera modes.
HEMERA_MODE_NORMAL_I18N="normal"
HEMERA_MODE_SECURITY_I18N="security"
HEMERA_MODE_PARROT_I18N="parrot"

## Commands.
# Internationalized command patterns.
# Each command must fit the syntax (take care of the space after/before parenthesis): ( "<pattern1>" ["<pattern2>" ... "<patternN>"] )
# These patterns will be directly used with =~ GNU/Bash binary operator;
#  so, corresponding syntax must be extended regular expression like in regex3.
# Each pattern must correspond to only ONE word, characters with accent are allowed.
# Each pattern must be put in double quotes.
# Several patterns can be specified for the same command, they must be space separated.
# e.g. for the command SAY, let's say we want "say" and something beginning by "rep" (like repeat), the format will so be:
# ( "say" "rep.*" )
MODE_CMD_PATTERN_I18N=( "mode" )
SAY_CMD_PATTERN_I18N=( "say" "repeat" )
SEARCH_CMD_PATTERN_I18N=( "search" )
PAUSE_CMD_PATTERN_I18N=( "pause" "wait" )
CONTINUE_CMD_PATTERN_I18N=( "continue" )
STOP_CMD_PATTERN_I18N=( "stop" )

# Information following successfull command recognition.
MODE_CMD_UPDATE_I18N="Activated mode"

# Command recognition error or bad use.
# Sometimes, variables are specified in strings, they will be replaced by corresponding value; in this case (and ONLY this one)
#  all following characters must be escaped: $'
MODE_CMD_BAD_USE_I18N="Mode command requires only one argument"
MODE_CMD_BAD_MODE_I18N="Mode \$badMode is not supported. Allowed modes are: \$supportedMode"
SAY_CMD_BAD_USE_I18N="Say command requires at least one argument"
SEARCH_CMD_BAD_USE_I18N="Search command requires at least one argument"
PAUSE_CMD_BAD_USE_I18N="Pause command doesn't require argument"
CONTINUE_CMD_BAD_USE_I18N="Continue command does not require argument"
STOP_CMD_BAD_USE_I18N="Stop command does not require argument"

NOT_RECOGNIZED_COMMAND_I18N="Command not recognized !"
NOT_FOUND_COMMAND_I18N="Command not found : \$notFoundCommand"
