To add a new command:
 - create a new script NOT executable in this directory (see 'say' command script as sample)
 - define the keyword of your command in comment, just after the Description, taking care of syntax
 - update [HEMERA_ROOT_PATH]/locale/hemera-i18n.xx files to
   - add XXX_PATTERN_I18N, XXX corresponding to your keyword
   - add any internationalized message you need
 - implement your command in your new script file

Command script files must NOT be executable (they must NOT be launched directly), they are internally launched by Hemera system.

You can use following variables:
$_inputPath: the path of the input to manage
$inputString: a string presentation of the input (useful for message)
$recoCmdMode: the Hemera mode
$potentialCommand: the recognized command (1 word)
$wordsCount: the count of recognized words, including $potentialCommand (allowing to ensure command arguments has been specified)

You can use following functions:
writeMessage <message>
 -> write message on standard output
warning <message>
 -> write message (prefixed with 'Warning' keyword) on error output
speechToSay <message> <input path>
 -> a new 'speech' input, containing specified message will be generated, including specified input path (to track inputs)
notifyErrInput
 -> the input management will be regarded as error (a message will give this information)
notifyDoneInput
 -> the input management will be regarded as successfull (a message will give this information)
